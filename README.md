# edbw

edbw is a Django based web application for managing lab experiments allowing users to query microarray, RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq data generated by
a lab. It is designed to provide a lab with a straightforward way to centralize data and make it accessible. Its design goal was based on the
need of a lab to reduce its dependence on ad-hoc CD-ROM and hard drive storage and provide a way to make data accessible to all lab members.
